JMAP (JSON Meta Application Protocol) isn't just another email protocol; it's a fundamental rethinking of how email clients should communicate with servers. For decades, IMAP has been the standard, but it was designed for a different era of the internet. At emay.me, we chose to build our entire platform on JMAP for a few key reasons: speed, efficiency, and a better user experience.

## Unmatched Speed

IMAP is a "chatty" protocol. A simple action like fetching new mail can require multiple round-trips between the client and server. JMAP, on the other hand, is designed for batching. It can bundle multiple commands into a single HTTP request, dramatically reducing latency.

**What this means for you:** Your inbox loads faster. Searching is quicker. Actions are instantaneous. There's no more waiting for your client to sync with the server.

## Incredible Efficiency

JMAP uses JSON, a lightweight and modern data format that's easy to parse. More importantly, it's designed to minimize data transfer. Clients can request only the specific data they need, nothing more. For example, instead of downloading an entire email to see a snippet, a JMAP client can request just the first 100 characters.

**What this means for you:** Lower data usage on your mobile plan and longer battery life for your devices. Our purpose-built clients leverage this to be as lean as possible.

## Built for the Modern Web

JMAP is a stateful protocol built on top of stateless HTTP. This makes it perfect for web and mobile applications. It enables features like reliable push notifications without the constant polling that drains battery life.

**What this means for you:** You get notified of new emails instantly, without compromising your device's performance.

By building on JMAP, we're not just offering another email service. We're offering a glimpse into the future of emailâ€”one that's faster, lighter, and built for the way we live and work today.
