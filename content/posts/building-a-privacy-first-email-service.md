Privacy isn't just a feature—it's the foundation of everything we do at emay.me. In an era where your inbox is often treated as a data goldmine, we've taken a radically different approach.

## No Tracking, No Ads, No Data Mining

Unlike the big email providers, we don't scan your emails to show you ads. We don't track your behavior to build advertising profiles. We don't sell your data to third parties. Our business model is simple: we provide a great service, and users who need more pay for it.

## End-to-End Encryption by Default

Every email you send and receive through emay.me is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure that only you and your intended recipients can read your messages.

## Minimal Data Collection

We only collect the data we absolutely need to provide our service. No behavioral tracking, no unnecessary metadata collection, no "analytics" that compromise your privacy.

## Open Source Transparency

Our commitment to privacy isn't just words—it's code. Key components of our infrastructure are open source, allowing security researchers and privacy advocates to verify our claims.

## The Future of Private Communication

Privacy shouldn't be a luxury. It should be the default. That's why our free plan includes all the privacy features that other providers charge extra for.
